# Playing with Simulating Door Behavior and Extensions

This playful task is designed to introduce you to the basics of object-oriented programming. You'll be creating objects for a "Door" and its "Knob", and then simulating how they interact. As a fun twist, you'll also add quirky features to the door, like a "Stopper" and a "Closer", using inheritance, mixins, and traits. Dive in and see how you can use these object-oriented concepts in a light-hearted way!
